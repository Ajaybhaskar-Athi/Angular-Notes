**Decorators: Metadata and Behavior Modification**

* **Definition:**
    * Decorators are a special syntax (`@expression`) that adds metadata and modifies the behavior of classes, methods, properties, or parameters.
* **Purpose:**
    * **Metadata:**
        * Attach extra information to code elements.
        * This metadata can be used by frameworks, libraries, or other parts of the application.
    * **Behavior Modification:**
        * Alter or extend the functionality of the decorated code.
        * Enable cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, validation).
    * **Reusability:**
        * Create reusable patterns that can be applied consistently.
* **Syntax:**
    * `@expression` placed before the declaration it decorates.
* **Types:**
    * Class decorators
    * Method decorators
    * Property decorators
    * Parameter decorators.
* **How they work:**
    * Decorators are functions that receive a reference to the decorated element as an argument.
    * They can then manipulate that element or return a modified version.

**Decorators in Angular:**

* **Framework Reliance:** 
    * Angular heavily uses decorators to define its core building blocks.
* **Key Examples:**
    * `@Component`: Defines an Angular component with its metadata.
    * `@Directive`: Defines an Angular directive.
    * `@Injectable`: Marks a class as available for dependency injection.
    * `@Input`, `@Output`: Defines component input and output properties.
* **Angular's Usage:**
    * Angular decorators provide the framework with the necessary information to process and manage components, directives, and services.
    * They are essential for Angular's compilation and runtime behavior.
