### **Module vs. Standalone Components in Angular**  

#### **Non-Standalone Components (Module-Based Approach)**  
- A **non-standalone component** is a component that is **declared inside an Angular module** instead of being self-contained.  
- These components are included in the `declarations` array of an `@NgModule` in a separate `module.ts` file.  
- Other components use them via the module rather than importing them directly.  

#### **Bootstrapping in `main.ts`**  
- **Standalone App** → Uses `bootstrapApplication(AppComponent)`.  
- **Module-Based App** → Uses `platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)`.  

This modular approach helps in better organization and reusability of components across the application.
