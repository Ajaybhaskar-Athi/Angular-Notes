**Angular: A Modern Web Framework**

* **What it is:**
    * Angular is a powerful, open-source JavaScript framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications (SPAs).
    * It provides a structured way to create complex, maintainable web interfaces.
* **Key Features:**
    * Component-based architecture: Applications are built from reusable components.
    * Declarative templates: HTML is extended with Angular's syntax for data binding.
    * Dependency injection: Manages dependencies for better testability and modularity.
    * Routing: Enables navigation between different views within the application.
    * Robust tooling: Provides a command-line interface (CLI) for efficient development.
* **How it Changed Web Development:**
    * **Shift from jQuery:**
        * Older web development often relied on jQuery for DOM manipulation.
        * Angular introduced a more structured, data-driven approach.
    * **Single-Page Applications:**
        * Angular made it easier to build SPAs, providing a smoother user experience.
    * **Modular and Maintainable Code:**
        * The component-based architecture and dependency injection promote code reusability and maintainability.
    * **Modern Development Practices:**
        * Encourages the use of TypeScript, leading to better code quality and fewer runtime errors.
    * **Stand alone components:**
        * The newest versions of angular are moving away from the use of NgModules, and instead using stand alone components. this creates a more simple and streamlined developement experience.
