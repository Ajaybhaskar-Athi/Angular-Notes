### **🔹 What is Dependency Injection (DI)?**
Dependency Injection (DI) is a **design pattern** used in Angular to manage dependencies efficiently. Instead of manually creating instances of a class, **Angular injects** the required dependencies (like services) into components, directives, or other services.
-Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used in Angular to provide dependencies (services, objects, or values) to classes without creating them manually inside the class. It helps in writing modular, maintainable, and testable code.

Benefits of DI:
✔ No new keyword → More flexible, easy to replace services.
✔ Easy to test → Can use mocks instead of real services.
✔ Angular handles object lifecycle.

### **🔹 Why is DI Useful in Services?**
1. **Reusability** – Services can be injected into multiple components without creating multiple instances.
2. **Singleton Pattern** – Services provided at the root level are **shared across the application** (one instance).
3. **Easier Unit Testing** – Allows mocking dependencies instead of relying on real implementations.
4. **Loose Coupling** – Components depend on abstractions (services) rather than concrete implementations.
5. **Automatic Lifecycle Management** – Angular handles object creation and destruction.

### **🔹 Why Not Use `new TaskService()`?**
✅ If we use `new TaskService()`, we manually create a new instance **every time** the component needs the service.  
❌ This **breaks the singleton pattern**, leading to unnecessary memory usage and state loss between components.  

Instead, we use **constructor injection**, so Angular provides the same instance of the service wherever it is required.

```ts
constructor(private taskService: TaskService) {}
```

This way, Angular:
- **Manages the service instance** efficiently.
- **Ensures the same instance is used** throughout the app.
- **Automatically injects dependencies** required by the service.

### Injecting a Service with inject() in Angular


Instead of injecting a service through the constructor, Angular provides an alternative method using the inject() function.


import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { TaskService } from '../task.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-task-list',
  templateUrl: './task-list.component.html',
})
export class TaskListComponent {
  private taskService = inject(TaskService); // Injecting without constructor
  tasks = this.taskService.getTasks();
}
