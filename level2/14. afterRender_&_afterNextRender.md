### **ðŸ“Œ `afterRender` and `afterNextRender` in Angular**  

#### **ðŸ”¹ What is `afterRender`?**  
- `afterRender` is a function that registers a callback to be executed **after Angular finishes rendering all components into the DOM**.  
- It runs **after the current rendering cycle** but before the browser repaints.  
- Useful for performing **post-render tasks** like animations or measuring layout.  

âœ… **Example:**  
```ts
import { afterRender } from '@angular/core';

afterRender(() => {
  console.log('All components have been rendered in the DOM!');
});
```

---

#### **ðŸ”¹ What is `afterNextRender`?**  
- `afterNextRender` is similar to `afterRender`, but it executes **only once after the next rendering cycle**.  
- Useful for **one-time post-render tasks** that donâ€™t need to run on every change detection cycle.  

âœ… **Example:**  
```ts
import { afterNextRender } from '@angular/core';

afterNextRender(() => {
  console.log('This runs only once after the next render!');
});
```

### **ðŸ”¹ Key Differences from Lifecycle Hooks**
| Feature              | `afterRender` / `afterNextRender` | Normal Lifecycle Hooks (e.g., `ngOnInit`) |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Execution Context   | Runs globally for the entire app | Runs only within a specific component |
| Runs After Render?  | Yes, after Angular renders the DOM | Yes, but tied to a component instance |
| Runs Once?         | `afterRender`: Runs every render cycle <br> `afterNextRender`: Runs only once | Runs based on component lifecycle |
| Standalone?        | Yes, not a method inside a class | No, must be a method inside a class |

### **ðŸ“Œ When to Use?**  
âœ” Use `afterRender` for tasks that need to run **after every render cycle**.  
âœ” Use `afterNextRender` for **one-time tasks** after the next render.  
âœ” Donâ€™t use these for logic tied to a **specific componentâ€™s lifecycle**â€”use lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit` instead.
