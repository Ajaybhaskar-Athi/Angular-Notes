In Angular, the traditional `@ViewChild` decorator has been complemented by the introduction of the `viewChild` function, which leverages Angular's signal-based reactivity system. This modern approach provides a more streamlined and reactive way to access and interact with DOM elements, directives, or child components within a component's template.

**Understanding the `viewChild` Function:**

The `viewChild` function is part of Angular's signal-based query API, offering an alternative to the decorator-based `@ViewChild`. When invoked, it returns a signal—a special kind of reactive value—that automatically updates whenever the queried element changes. This ensures that your component remains in sync with the template's state without the need for manual lifecycle management.
- `you don’t need ngAfterViewInit() to avoid undefined errors when using viewChild() because:`
. The signal updates automatically when the view initializes.
. You can safely access the value at any time, and it will update once the child is available.

**Key Differences Between `@ViewChild` and `viewChild`:**

- **Reactivity:** `viewChild` provides a signal that reacts to changes in the DOM, enabling more declarative and reactive code patterns.

- **Lifecycle Hooks:** With `viewChild`, there's often no need to rely on lifecycle hooks like `ngAfterViewInit` to access the queried element, simplifying the component's logic.

**Example: Accessing and Resetting a Form Using `viewChild`:**

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `viewChild` function to access a form element and reset it upon form submission:

```typescript
import { Component, ElementRef, viewChild } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-new-ticket',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [FormsModule],
  templateUrl: './new-ticket.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./new-ticket.component.css']
})
export class NewTicketComponent {
  // Using viewChild function to create a signal for the form element
  private form = viewChild<ElementRef<HTMLFormElement>>('form');

  // Method to handle form submission
  onSubmit(titleInp: string, textInp: string) {
    console.log(titleInp, textInp);
    // Resetting the form using the signal
    this.form()?.nativeElement.reset();
  }
}
```


**Template (`new-ticket.component.html`):**

```html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(titleInput.value, textInput.value)" #form>
  <input type="text" #titleInput placeholder="Title" required>
  <textarea #textInput placeholder="Description" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```


**Explanation:**

- **Defining the Signal:** The `viewChild` function is used to create a signal that references the form element identified by the template reference variable `#form`.

- **Accessing the Form:** Within the `onSubmit` method, the form is accessed through the signal by invoking `this.form()`. This retrieves the current value of the signal, which is the `ElementRef` of the form.

- **Resetting the Form:** The form is reset by calling the `reset()` method on the native form element: `this.form()?.nativeElement.reset();`. The optional chaining (`?.`) ensures that the method is called only if the form element exists.

**Advantages of Using `viewChild`:**

- **Enhanced Reactivity:** Signals automatically update in response to changes, reducing the need for manual DOM checks.

- **Simplified Code:** Eliminates the necessity for certain lifecycle hooks, leading to cleaner and more maintainable code.
