### **📌 `ngDoChecked` in Angular**  

#### **🔹 What is `ngDoChecked`?**  
- `ngDoChecked` is a lifecycle hook that gets called **during every change detection cycle**.  
- It allows you to implement **custom change detection logic**.  
- Unlike `ngOnChanges`, which only runs when `@Input` properties change, `ngDoChecked` runs **whenever Angular checks for changes**, even if nothing has changed.  

---

### **✅ Example: Using `ngDoChecked`**
```ts
import { Component, DoCheck, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-demo',
  template: `<p>{{ data }}</p>`
})
export class DemoComponent implements DoCheck {
  @Input() data!: string;

  ngDoCheck() {
    console.log('ngDoCheck called - Custom change detection logic here');
  }
}
```
🔹 This will log a message **every time Angular runs change detection**, even if `data` hasn't changed.

### **🔹 When to Use `ngDoChecked`?**
✔ When you need **fine-grained control** over change detection.  
✔ When changes occur inside **objects or arrays**, and `ngOnChanges` doesn’t detect them.  
✔ When implementing **performance optimizations** to reduce unnecessary updates.

### **🔹 Key Difference from `ngOnChanges`**
| Feature         | `ngOnChanges` | `ngDoChecked` |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Runs when? | Only when `@Input()` properties change | Every change detection cycle |
| Detects object mutation? | ❌ No (detects reference change only) | ✅ Yes (can detect internal changes) |
| Use case | Reacting to `@Input()` property changes | Custom change detection logic |

---

### **📌 When NOT to Use `ngDoChecked`?**
🚫 Avoid heavy computations inside `ngDoChecked` as it runs **very frequently**, which can impact performance.  
🚫 Don't use it if `ngOnChanges` is enough for detecting changes in `@Input()` values.
