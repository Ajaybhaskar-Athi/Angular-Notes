In Angular 16, a new provider called `DestroyRef` has been introduced to streamline the management of cleanup tasks when a component, directive, pipe, embedded view, or an instance of `EnvironmentInjector` is destroyed. This feature offers a more flexible and injectable alternative to the traditional `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook. citeturn0search4

**Key Features of `DestroyRef`:**

- **Injectable Cleanup:** By injecting `DestroyRef`, developers can register callback functions that Angular will execute just before the destruction of the associated scope. This approach allows for a more modular and reusable cleanup logic. citeturn0search3

- **Simplified Subscription Management:** `DestroyRef` can be utilized to automatically unsubscribe from observables, thereby preventing potential memory leaks without the need to manually implement the `ngOnDestroy` method. citeturn0search2

**Usage Example:**

Here's how you can implement `DestroyRef` to manage an observable subscription:




**Advantages Over `ngOnDestroy`:**

- **Flexibility:** Unlike `ngOnDestroy`, which requires implementing the `OnDestroy` interface, `DestroyRef` can be injected and used directly within the constructor or other injection contexts, providing more flexibility in managing cleanup logic. citeturn0search1

- **Modularity:** With `DestroyRef`, it's possible to create reusable cleanup functions that can be shared across different components or services, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy. citeturn0search3
