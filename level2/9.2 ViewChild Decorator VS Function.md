In Angular, both the `@ViewChild` decorator and the `viewChild()` function are used to access elements, directives, or child components within a component's view. However, they differ in their behavior and the timing of when the queried elements become available.

**`@ViewChild` Decorator:**

- **Initialization Timing:** When using the `@ViewChild` decorator, the referenced element or component becomes available only after Angular has fully initialized the component's view. Attempting to access it before the `ngAfterViewInit` lifecycle hook will result in an `undefined` value. Therefore, any logic that depends on the `@ViewChild` reference should be placed within the `ngAfterViewInit` method to ensure the view has been initialized.

- **Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { Component, ViewChild, AfterViewInit } from '@angular/core';
  
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    template: `<input #inputRef type="text" />`
  })
  export class ExampleComponent implements AfterViewInit {
    @ViewChild('inputRef') inputElement: ElementRef;
  
    ngAfterViewInit() {
      // Safe to access this.inputElement here
      this.inputElement.nativeElement.focus();
    }
  }
  ```


**`viewChild()` Function:**

- **Reactive Signals:** The `viewChild()` function, introduced in Angular's signal-based reactivity system, provides a reactive signal that updates as the application state changes. This means that the reference is synchronized with the DOM and can be accessed safely at any point without waiting for a specific lifecycle hook. The signal automatically reflects the current state of the DOM, ensuring that the reference is always up-to-date.

- **Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { Component, ElementRef, viewChild } from '@angular/core';
  
  @Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    template: `<input #inputRef type="text" />`
  })
  export class ExampleComponent {
    inputElement = viewChild<ElementRef>('inputRef');
  
    focusInput() {
      // Safe to access this.inputElement() here
      this.inputElement()?.nativeElement.focus();
    }
  }
  ```


**Key Differences:**

- **Access Timing:** With `@ViewChild`, the reference is available only after the view has been initialized, necessitating the use of lifecycle hooks like `ngAfterViewInit`. In contrast, `viewChild()` provides a reactive signal that is synchronized with the DOM, allowing safe access at any point without relying on specific lifecycle hooks.

- **Reactivity:** The `viewChild()` function offers a reactive signal that automatically updates as the DOM changes, providing a more dynamic and responsive approach to interacting with the view.

In summary, while both `@ViewChild` and `viewChild()` serve to access elements or components within a view, `viewChild()` offers a more flexible and reactive approach, eliminating the need to wait for specific lifecycle hooks and ensuring synchronization with the DOM state.
