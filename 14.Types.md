### **Interface in TypeScript**  
An `interface` defines the structure of an object. It describes what properties and methods an object should have but does not define values. Interfaces are mainly used for **object type definitions** and support **extension (`extends`)** and **declaration merging**.

- ✅ Used for objects and classes  
- ✅ Supports extension (`extends`)  
- ✅ Supports declaration merging  
- ❌ Cannot define union or intersection types

### **Type in TypeScript**  
A `type` is more flexible and can define **objects, primitives, unions, and intersections**. It allows combining multiple types and can represent more complex structures.

- ✅ Can define objects, primitives, unions, and intersections  
- ✅ Supports intersections (`&`) for combining types  
- ❌ Does not support declaration merging  
- ❌ Cannot extend like interfaces (`extends` does not work)

### **Simple Difference**  
- Use **`interface`** when defining object shapes and working with classes.  
- Use **`type`** when defining complex types, unions, or combining multiple types.
