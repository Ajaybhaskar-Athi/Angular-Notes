### **What is Dynamic Routing?**  
Dynamic routing is a technique used in web applications where routes are determined at runtime based on dynamic parameters, rather than being predefined. This allows applications to handle different users, products, or other entities dynamically.

In **Angular**, dynamic routing is typically implemented using the **RouterModule** and the **`routerLink` directive**. It allows navigation to routes with parameters, such as user IDs or product IDs.

### **Using Dynamic Routing in an Angular Template**
You have provided two different ways of defining a dynamic route inside an Angular template:
```typescript
import { bootstrapApplication } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { provideRouter, Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { UserComponent } from './user.component';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'users/:id', component: UserComponent }, // Dynamic route with "id" parameter
];

bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [provideRouter(routes)],
}).catch(err => console.error(err));
```

#### **1. String Concatenation Approach**
```html
<a [routerLink]="'users/' + user().id" routerLinkActive="selected">
```
- The **`routerLink`** directive is set to a dynamically generated string (`'users/' + user().id`).
- The route will resolve to something like:
  ```
  /users/123  (if user().id is 123)
  ```

#### **2. Array Syntax Approach (Recommended)**
```html
<a [routerLink]="['users', user().id]" routerLinkActive="selected">
```
- This approach uses an **array** to define the route.
- It ensures Angular handles the URL properly and prevents manual string concatenation errors.
- It resolves to:
  ```
  /users/123  (if user().id is 123)
  ```

### **Which One is Better?**
âœ… **The second approach** `[routerLink]="['users', user().id]"` is the preferred method because:
- It ensures correct URL encoding.
- It avoids manual string concatenation errors.
- It's more readable and maintainable.
