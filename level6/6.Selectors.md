### **📌 What Are Selector Functions in NgRx?**  

Selector functions in **NgRx** are used to extract specific data from the **global state (store)**. Instead of fetching the entire state and filtering it **manually**, selectors provide a **structured and optimized** way to access the state.  
-- Creating Selectors is same in both older and newer versions of NgRx

- Selectors are the best way to access and return the current store state.
---

## **🔴 Problem Without Selectors**  
Imagine you have a **global state (store)** like this:  
```ts
{
  counter: 10,
  user: {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
  }
}
```
Now, you want to display the `counter` value in a component.  
### ❌ **Directly Fetching State (Bad Approach)**
```ts
this.count$ = this.store.select(state => state.counter);
```
### 🚨 Problems:
1️⃣ **Repetitive Code** → If many components need `counter`, you must write this **again and again**.  
2️⃣ **No Optimization** → Every time **any part of the state changes**, this function runs **even if `counter` hasn't changed**.  
3️⃣ **Not Scalable** → If the state structure changes later, you must update **all components** manually.

## **📌 `createFeatureSelector` vs `createSelector` in NgRx**  

NgRx provides two powerful functions, **`createFeatureSelector`** and **`createSelector`**, to efficiently extract data from the store. Let's break them down.  

---

## **🔷 `createFeatureSelector`**
`createFeatureSelector` is used to **select an entire feature state** from the global store.  

### **🔹 Why Use It?**  
- It helps in **accessing a feature slice** of the state directly.  
- It is **used as an input** for `createSelector`.  
- It is useful when managing **multiple state slices**.


## **🔷 `createSelector`**
`createSelector` is used to **extract specific pieces of data** from a state.  

### **🔹 Why Use It?**  
- It **filters only the required data**, instead of accessing the entire state.  
- It **memoizes (caches) results**, preventing unnecessary recalculations.  
- It **can combine multiple selectors** to create derived data.  






In NgRx, we need **reducers** to manage the state changes and **selectors** to access specific pieces of data efficiently.  

---

## **🛠 Step 1: Define the State and Reducer**
Let’s assume our global store has this structure:

```ts
{
  counter: 10,
  user: {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
  }
}
```

We'll define a **reducer** to manage this state.

### **🔹 Define Initial State (`app.state.ts`)**
```ts
export interface AppState {
  counter: number;
  user: {
    name: string;
    age: number;
  };
}

export const initialState: AppState = {
  counter: 0,
  user: {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
  }
};
```

---

### **🔹 Create Reducer (`app.reducer.ts`)**
```ts
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { increment, decrement, setUserName } from "./app.actions";
import { initialState } from "./app.state";

export const appReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,

  on(increment, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    counter: state.counter + 1
  })),

  on(decrement, (state) => ({
    ...state,
    counter: state.counter - 1
  })),

  on(setUserName, (state, { name }) => ({
    ...state,
    user: { ...state.user, name }
  }))
);
```
> Here, `increment`, `decrement`, and `setUserName` are **actions** that update the state.

---

## **🛠 Step 2: Create Selectors**
Since we **cannot directly access the store**, we use **selectors** to retrieve values from the state.

### **🔹 Define Selectors (`app.selectors.ts`)**
```ts
import { createFeatureSelector, createSelector } from "@ngrx/store";
import { AppState } from "./app.state";

// 1️⃣ Select the entire AppState
export const selectAppState = createFeatureSelector<AppState>('app'); //'app' is th elsice name we given in the main.ts for our reducer

// 2️⃣ Select the Counter Value
export const selectCounter = createSelector(
  selectAppState,
  (state) => state.counter
);

// 3️⃣ Select the User Object
export const selectUser = createSelector(
  selectAppState,
  (state) => state.user
);

// 4️⃣ Select Only the User Name
export const selectUserName = createSelector(
  selectUser,
  (user) => user.name
);
```

---

## **🛠 Step 3: Use Selectors in Components**
Now, we can use these selectors inside our components.

### **🔹 Example Component Usage**
```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Store } from '@ngrx/store';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { selectCounter, selectUserName } from './app.selectors';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-counter',
  template: `
    <h1>Counter: {{ counter$ | async }}</h1>
    <h2>User Name: {{ userName$ | async }}</h2>
  `
})
export class CounterComponent {
  counter$: Observable<number>;
  userName$: Observable<string>;

  constructor(private store: Store) {
    this.counter$ = this.store.select(selectCounter);
    this.userName$ = this.store.select(selectUserName);
  }
}
```

## **🎯 Why Do We Need Selectors?**
✅ **Performance Optimization** → Selectors **memoize** (cache) values, preventing unnecessary recalculations.  
✅ **Encapsulation** → Components do not need to know how the state is structured.  
✅ **Reusability** → Instead of writing the same logic multiple times, we define selectors **once** and use them everywhere.  

🚀 **Final Thought:**  
We **need reducers to update the state** and **selectors to efficiently extract the data** from the store. This makes NgRx powerful and scalable! 🔥
