### **NgRx Effects (Why and What?)**
- **Why Needed?**  
  Reducers should be **pure functions** (no side effects). But we often need to handle **async tasks** like:
  - HTTP requests  
  - Local storage updates  
  - Timers or logging  
- **What is an Effect?**  
  - **Like a service** `that listens for actions` and handles side effects (async tasks).  
  - Uses RxJS operators (`tap`, `map`, `switchMap`, etc.).  
  - Decorated with `@Injectable()` so it can be provided via dependency injection.  

---

### **Selectors (What & Why?)**  
- **Why?**  
  - Help **fetch & derive** data from the store in a **structured** way.  
  - Avoids **manual state manipulation** inside components.  
- **Example:**  
  ```typescript
  export const selectCount = createFeatureSelector<number>('counter');
  
  export const selectDoubleCount = createSelector(
      selectCount,
      (counter) => counter * 2
  );
  ```
  - `selectCount`: Selects the `counter` value from the store.  
  - `selectDoubleCount`: Computes derived state (`counter * 2`).  

---

### **NgRx Effects Example (Saving Count to LocalStorage)**  
```typescript
saveCount = createEffect(
  () =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(incrementAction, decrementAction),  // Listen for these actions
      withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectCount)), // Get latest count
      tap(([action, count]) => {  //Mmally we get only action here BUT  WithLatestForm it returns an array with 2 elements: action and the elemnt in the observable u selectd
        console.log("Effect Triggered:", action);
        console.log("Current Store Count:", count);
        localStorage.setItem("count", count.toString());  // Save to LocalStorage
      })
    ),
  { dispatch: false }  // No new action is dispatched
);
```
- `withLatestFrom(this.store.select(selectCount))`:  
  - **Converts an observable** into the latest emitted value (sync-like behavior).  
  - When an action is dispatched, it **grabs the latest count** and emits `[action, count]`.  
  - Prevents using outdated store values.

### **Final Summary**
- **Reducers**: Update state **(pure functions, no side effects).**  
- **Effects**: Handle side effects **(async tasks like API calls, LocalStorage).**  
- **Selectors**: Fetch and compute state **(avoid manual state access in components).**  
- **`withLatestFrom`**: Takes the latest emitted value from an observable and pairs it with the action.
