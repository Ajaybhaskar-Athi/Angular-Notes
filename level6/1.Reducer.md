Yes! There are **two ways** to create a reducer in NgRx:

---

## **1. Using `createReducer` (Recommended)**
This approach uses the `createReducer` function from `@ngrx/store`, which makes it easier to define reducers in a clean and readable way.
- In NgRx, we only define actions inside reducers if they modify the store state.

### **Example:**
```ts
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { increment, decrement, reset } from "./counter.actions";

const initialState = 0;

export const counterReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(increment, (state) => state + 1),
  on(decrement, (state) => state - 1),
  on(reset, () => initialState)
);
```
### âœ… **Why use `createReducer`?**
- Cleaner syntax.
- Automatically handles **immutability**.
- Works well with **NgRx actions** (`on()` method).
- Prevents common mistakes in reducer logic.

## **2. Using a Traditional Reducer Function**
In this approach, we manually define a function that takes `state` and `action`, then returns the new state.

### **Example:**
```ts
import { Action } from "@ngrx/store";

const initialState = 0;

export function counterReducer(state = initialState, action: Action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "[Counter] Increment":
      return state + 1;
    case "[Counter] Decrement":
      return state - 1;
    case "[Counter] Reset":
      return initialState;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
### âœ… **Why use a function-based reducer?**
- Useful if you want full control over the reducer.
- Can be used in non-NgRx contexts.
- Some developers prefer explicit `switch-case` statements.

---

## **Which One to Use?**
âœ… **Use `createReducer`** if you're working with NgRxâ€”it is more maintainable and readable.  
âœ… **Use a function-based reducer** if you prefer explicit control or are using NgRx in a legacy project.
