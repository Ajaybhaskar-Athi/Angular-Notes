In NgRx, we can create actions in **two ways**:  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `createAction` (Modern & Recommended)**
This approach uses the `createAction` function to define actions in a **cleaner and more maintainable** way.

#### **Creating Action (`counter.actions.ts`)**
```ts
import { createAction } from "@ngrx/store";

export const incrementAction = createAction('[Counter] Increment');
```

#### **Using it in `createReducer` (`counter.reducer.ts`)**
```ts
import { createReducer, on } from "@ngrx/store";
import { incrementAction } from "./counter.actions";

const initialState = 0;

export const counterReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(incrementAction, (state) => state + 1)
);
```
‚úÖ **Advantages**:  
- Less boilerplate.  
- Automatic type safety with `on()`.  
- Easier to read and maintain.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Traditional Way (Without `createReducer`)**
Before `createReducer`, actions were created using **`Action` interfaces** and handled with `switch-case` inside a function.

#### **Creating Action (`counter.actions.ts`)**
```ts
import { Action } from "@ngrx/store";

// Define Action Types
export const INCREMENT = '[Counter] Increment';

// Define Action Class
export class Increment implements Action {
  readonly type = INCREMENT;
}

// Union Type for Actions
export type CounterActions = Increment;
```

#### **Using it in Reducer (`counter.reducer.ts`)**
```ts
import { Action } from "@ngrx/store";
import { INCREMENT, CounterActions } from "./counter.actions";

const initialState = 0;

export function counterReducer(state = initialState, action: CounterActions) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case INCREMENT:
      return state + 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```
‚úÖ **Advantages**:  
- Gives **full control** over the reducer logic.  
- Can be useful in **complex reducers**.  

‚ùå **Disadvantages**:  
- More **boilerplate code**.  
- **Manual action types** (string constants).  
- Need to **define an Action class** for every action.

### **Which One to Use?**
‚úÖ **Use `createAction` + `createReducer`** for simplicity and maintainability.  
‚úÖ **Use the traditional method** if working on a **legacy project** or needing explicit action typing.  

Would you like me to show an example with **multiple actions** (increment, decrement, reset)? üöÄ
