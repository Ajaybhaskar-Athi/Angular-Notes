### **Where/How Does TypeScript Code Run?**  

TypeScript code **never runs directly** in your browser. Your browser can only understand **JavaScript**.  

#### **Key Points:**  
1. **JavaScript is the runtime language** â€“ It is what actually runs in your browser or Node.js environment.  
2. **TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript** â€“ It adds static typing and other features but needs to be converted to JavaScript.  
3. **Compilation Process** â€“ TypeScript is **compiled (transpiled)** into JavaScript before execution.  
4. **Type Checking** â€“ If there are type errors in TypeScript, the compilation to JavaScript **fails**, similar to how   C++ catches errors before running.

### **What is TypeScript?**  
TypeScript is an **open-source, strongly typed** programming language developed by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding **optional static typing, interfaces, and better tooling support**.  

ðŸ”¹ **TypeScript = JavaScript + Static Types**  

ðŸ‘‰ It is mainly used for **large-scale applications** to improve maintainability, scalability, and error detection.
