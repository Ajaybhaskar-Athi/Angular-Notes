### **Definition of Interfaces in TypeScript & Angular**  
An **interface** is a blueprint that defines the **structure** of an object but **does not provide implementation**. It ensures that a class or object follows a specific structure, improving **type safety** and **code consistency**.

### **Why Are Interfaces Used?**  
1. **Enforces Structure** – Ensures objects follow a predefined shape.  
2. **Type Safety** – Helps catch errors at compile time.  
3. **Code Reusability** – Can be used across multiple components and services.  
4. **Supports Dependency Injection** – Often used in Angular services to define expected data formats.
