### **Why is a Class Needed in Angular?**  
1. **Encapsulation** â€“ Keeps data and logic together in a structured way.  
2. **Reusability** â€“ Allows defining reusable services, models, and components.  
3. **Dependency Injection** â€“ Services in Angular are classes that provide shared functionality.  
4. **Type Safety** â€“ Helps enforce strong typing when using TypeScript.  
5. **Maintainability** â€“ Makes the code modular, easier to read, and manage.
