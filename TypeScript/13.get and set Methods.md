### **Definition of `get` and `set` in TypeScript:**  

- **`get` (Getter):** A method that allows you to **retrieve** a property value while keeping the actual property private.  
- **`set` (Setter):** A method that allows you to **modify** a property value while adding validation or logic before assignment.  



```typescript
class Product {
    private _price: number = 100;

    getPrice() {
        return this._price;
    }
}

const product = new Product();
console.log(product.getPrice()); // ‚úÖ Output: 100
```
It works similarly to a getter, but **there is a key difference** between `get` and a regular method.

## **Difference Between `get` and a Regular Method**
| Feature | `get price()` (Getter) | `getPrice()` (Method) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Access Style** | Accessed like a **property** (`product.price`) | Called like a **function** (`product.getPrice()`) |
| **Read-Only Behavior** | Acts like a **read-only** property | Just a method, no direct read-only enforcement |
| **Encapsulation** | Protects the private variable and provides controlled access | Also protects, but requires explicit method call |
| **Usability in Templates/Bindings** | Works like a normal property in frameworks like Angular, React | Requires function call in templates |

### **Example Comparison**
**Getter (`get`)**
```typescript
class Product {
    private _price: number = 100;

    get price(): number {
        return this._price;
    }
}

const product = new Product();
console.log(product.price); // ‚úÖ Looks like a property
```
‚úÖ Feels like a normal property (`product.price`).  
‚ùå **Cannot** pass arguments.

---

**Regular Method (`getPrice()`)**
```typescript
class Product {
    private _price: number = 100;

    getPrice() {
        return this._price;
    }
}

const product = new Product();
console.log(product.getPrice()); // ‚úÖ Must call as a function
```
‚úÖ Can pass **arguments** if needed (e.g., `getPrice(withTax: boolean)`).  
‚ùå Must always call as a function (`product.getPrice()`).

## **When to Use `get` vs. a Regular Method?**
| **Use `get`** when: | **Use a regular method** when: |
|----------------|------------------|
| You want to access data **like a property** (`product.price`) | You need to **pass parameters** (e.g., `getPrice(withTax: boolean)`) |
| The property should be **read-only** | The method **performs additional logic** like calculations |
| You want better **code readability** | You are following traditional OOP method conventions |

Would you like a real-world example where `get` is better than a method? üöÄ
