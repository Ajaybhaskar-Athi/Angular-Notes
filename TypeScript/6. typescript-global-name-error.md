    'name' was also declared here.


Found 1 error.




The error **`'name' was also declared here`** occurs because **`name` is a global variable in TypeScript's DOM library**, and you're trying to declare it again.  

---

### **âœ… Solution: Rename the Variable**
Since **`name` is already defined in the global scope**, you should use a different variable name.  

```ts
let myName: string = "Ajay"; // âœ… Renamed 'name' to 'myName'
console.log(myName);
```

---

### **ðŸš€ Alternative Fix: Use `var` or `let` Inside a Function**
If you **must** use `name`, wrap it inside a function so it doesnâ€™t conflict with the global declaration.  
```ts
function printName() {
    let name: string = "Ajay"; // âœ… Local scope, no conflict
    console.log(name);
}

printName();
```

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Why This Happens?**
- In TypeScript, the DOM library (`lib.dom.d.ts`) **already defines `name` globally**, so declaring it in your code **causes a conflict**.  
- `name` is globally available in the browser (`window.name`).  

ðŸ‘‰ **Best practice**: **Avoid using `name` as a variable name** in TypeScript projects.
