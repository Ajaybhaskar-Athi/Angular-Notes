### **Strongly Typed vs. Loosely Typed Languages**  

These terms refer to how programming languages handle types, particularly their strictness in type conversions and type safety.  

### **Strongly Typed Languages**  
- **Examples**: Java, C++, C, Rust  
- **Benefits**:  
  1. **Fewer runtime errors** – Errors related to types are caught at compile time.  
  2. **Stricter codebase** – Enforces clear type definitions, reducing unintended bugs.  
  3. **Easy to catch errors at compile time** – Prevents incorrect type assignments before execution.  

#### **Example (Code that won’t work due to strict typing)**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    int number;
    number = "text"; // Error: Cannot assign a string to an integer
    return 0;
}
```

### **Loosely Typed Languages**  
- **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Perl, PHP  
- **Benefits**:  
  1. **Easy to write code** – No need to explicitly declare variable types.  
  2. **Fast to bootstrap** – Rapid prototyping without type constraints.  
  3. **Low learning curve** – Beginner-friendly due to flexible type handling.  

#### **Example (Code that works despite type mismatch)**  
```javascript
function main() {
    let number = 10;
    number = "text"; // No error, type changes dynamically
    return number;
}
```

### **Why TypeScript?**  
JavaScript is a powerful language but lacks static typing, leading to unexpected errors.  
**TypeScript** was introduced to add **optional static typing** on top of JavaScript, making it safer and more maintainable.
